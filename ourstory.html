		<h1>Our Story</h1>

		<section>
			<p>It all started after Amanda and Amit moved to Philadelphia for graduate school.  Amanda attended Drexel University, while Amit attended the University of Pennsylvania.  Coincidentally, one of Amit's best childhood friend, Taky, knew Amanda, as they both attended Northwestern for their undergraduate studies.</p><br/>

			<p>Taky came to visit Amit on April 11th, 2011.  After going to a few bars, Taky had wanted to catch up with Amanda as well, given that he hasn't seen her since they both graduated Northwestern.  So, Taky and Amit went to Landmark Bar and Grill, a popular bar across the Drexel Law School, where Amit and Amanda had first met.  At the end of the night, Taky suggested that Amanda and I share contact information, since, according to Taky, "we should be friends."  Amit and Amanda exchanged phone numbers, went on their first date a week later, and the rest is history.</p>
